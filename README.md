# Drone-Sound-Detection-with-TinyML-on-Raspberry-Pi-4
This project leverages TinyML to deploy a lightweight machine learning model on a Raspberry Pi 4 to detect drones based on their audio signatures. The system processes sound input, extracts audio features, and classifies the presence of drones in real time.
